in this repository, I have saved Python codes I use in every project, such as ```AverageMeter```  class in ```utiles.py``` which is an accumulator and can be used to calculate average of loss in each epoch. 
in download accelerator folder, I have prepared some codes to download datasets in ```colab```.
I will add more other useful functions.
